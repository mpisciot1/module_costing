Module Costing
-
This repository is a collection of python scripts that can be used to calculate capital costs for equipment at a chemical engineering plant.
The capital cost calculations and correlations can be found in Analysis, Synthesis, and Design of Chemical Processes, Fourth Edition by Richard Turton, Richard C. Bailie, Wallace B. Whiting, Joseph A. Shaeiwitz, Debangsu Bhattacharyya and published by Pearson.

The equipment that can be capital costed using these models include:
- Blenders with configurations (and sizing):
  - Kneader (volume: 0.14 - 3 m3)
  - Ribbon (volume: 0.7 - 11 m3)
  - Rotary (volume: 0.7 - 11 m3)
- Centrifuges with configurations (and sizing):
  - Auto Batch Separator (diameter: 0.5 - 1.7 m)
  - Centrifugal Separator (diameter: 0.5 - 1 m)
  - Oscillating Screen (diameter: 0.5 - 1.1 m)
  - Solid Bowl with Motor (diameter: 0.5 - 2 m)
- Compressors with configurations (and sizing):
  - Centrifugal, axial, and reciprocating (fluid power: 450 - 3000 kW)
  - Rotary (fluid power: 18 - 950 kW)
