Module Costing
-
This repository is a collection of python scripts that can be used to calculate capital costs for equipment at a chemical engineering plant.
The capital cost calculations and correlations can be found in Analysis, Synthesis, and Design of Chemical Processes, Fourth Edition by Richard Turton, Richard C. Bailie, Wallace B. Whiting, Joseph A. Shaeiwitz, Debangsu Bhattacharyya and published by Pearson.

The equipment that can be capital costed using these models include:
- Blenders with configurations (and sizing in m3):
  - Kneader (0.14 - 3)
  - Ribbon (0.7 - 11)
  - Rotary (0.7 - 11)
- Centrifuges with configurations (and diameters in m):
  - Auto Batch Separator (0.5 - 1.7)
  - Centrifugal Separator (0.5 - 1)
  - Oscillating Screen (0.5 - 1.1)
  - Solid Bowl with Motor (0.5 - 2)
- Compressors with configurations (and sizing in fluid power, kW):
  - Centrifugal, axial, and reciprocating (450 - 3000)
  - Rotary (18 - 950)
